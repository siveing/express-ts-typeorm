# These owners will be the default owners for everything in
# the repo. Unless a later match takes precedence

# Change the next line to add your own reviewers

# Order is important; the last matching pattern takes the most
# precedence. When someone opens a pull request that only
# modifies JS files, only @some_user and not the global
# owner(s) will be requested for a review.

# *.js    @some_user
